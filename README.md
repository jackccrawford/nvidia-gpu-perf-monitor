# 🎮 NVIDIA GPU Performance Monitor

> "Information should not be displayed all at once; let people gradually become familiar with it." - Edward Tufte

Tired of playing "Find the Important Number" in your terminal while your ML model trains? Watching your GPU temperature shouldn't feel like decoding the Matrix. 

Do you find yourself:
- 👀 Constantly switching between terminal windows?
- 🔍 Squinting at rapidly changing numbers?
- 🤯 Missing critical spikes in GPU usage?
- 🌡️ Wondering if that temperature is actually concerning?
- 💭 Spending mental energy parsing dense data when you should be focusing on your work?

We've reimagined GPU monitoring with human-centered design principles. Instead of parsing dense terminal output, our dashboard leverages intuitive visual affordances - color gradients that immediately signal temperature states, progress bars that show memory usage at a glance, and trend indicators that make pattern recognition effortless.

This beautiful, real-time GPU monitoring dashboard transforms complex metrics into an intuitive interface. Built with React and Flask, it reduces cognitive load through thoughtful information hierarchy and visual signifiers, letting you focus on your work while maintaining awareness of your GPU's health.

*Transform complex GPU metrics into intuitive visual patterns*

Key Design Principles:
- Reduced Cognitive Load: Visual patterns over dense numbers
- Intuitive Signifiers: Color-coding that maps to severity levels
- Information Hierarchy: Critical metrics prominently displayed
- Pattern Recognition: Trend visualization for quick analysis
- Attention Management: Alerts that demand attention only when needed

- Duration tracking
- Performance metrics

 ⚠️ **CAUTION**: Never run stress tests for extended periods. This can damage your GPU!

## 🌡️ Temperature Monitoring

Color-coded temperature ranges for intuitive monitoring:
- 🔴 Red (≥85°C): Danger zone
- 🟠 Orange (80-84°C): Warning
- 🟡 Yellow (70-79°C): Normal gaming temp
- 💚 Green (65-69°C): Ideal temperature
- 💙 Blue (50-64°C): Cool
- 🟦 Indigo (<50°C): Very cool

## 🔒 Security Notes

- No sensitive data collection
- Local-only operation
- Process information filtered
- Safe subprocess execution
- Error handling for all operations
